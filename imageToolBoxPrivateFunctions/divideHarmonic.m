function NN = divideHarmonic(base, limit, W)
% Controls how blockproc divides the work between workers in parallel mode.
% As seen in parallel_function.  We opt to limit the amount of data a
% single worker can take to 1% for the sake of the waitbar responsiveness
% in long running calls to blockproc.

% necessarily less than N by the loop condition so we are able to
% guarantee that NN is monotonically increasing.
