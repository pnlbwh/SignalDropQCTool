% createWaitModePolygon(H_AX,FINISHED_CMENU_TEXT) creates a blocking
% instance of impoly parented to H_AX. The context menu description of the
% end of placement gesture receives the label FINISHED_CMENU_TEXT. Once the
% polygon is placed, it returns [XI,YI] vertices of where the polygon was
% oriented and PLACEMENT_CANCELLED which signals whether placement was
% cancelled.
